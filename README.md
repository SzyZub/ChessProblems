Knight's tour and N queen problem solving program using a backtracking algorithm allowing generating the next solution without clean reset created in C++ with the "RayLib" graphical library.

Size of the chessboard and the starting position of the first piece can be chosen. When working with 8x8 chessboard algorithms can take quite a bit - especially the knights one depending on the starting position.
